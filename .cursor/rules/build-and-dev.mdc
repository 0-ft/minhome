# Build & Dev Workflow

- **Never run build commands directly** (no `npx`, `npm run build`, `tsc`, etc.). All services run inside Docker containers.
- The dev environment uses **hot reload** via `make dev` (or `make logs-dev` to tail logs). It is typically already running in a terminal.
- To check for issues, read linter output or inspect the running dev server logs in the terminal -- do not attempt to compile or build locally.
